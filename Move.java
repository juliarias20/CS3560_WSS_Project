Class: Move
Description: This class represents moves that can be taken by the Player.
             It connects the Player, Brain, Vision, and Map classes.
Variables:
    - Map map: the Map in the game
    - Player player: the Player in the game
    - int currentX: the Player's current x-coordinate
    - int currentY: the Player's current y-coordinate
    - int newX: the new x-coordinate of the new Square relative to the current coordinate
    - int newY: the new y-coordinate of the new Square relative to the current coordinate
Methods:
    - getNewX(): returns new x-coordinate
    - getNewY(): returns new y-coordinate
    - execute(): 
TODO:
    1. Player.getCurrentSquare, Square.getCoordinates
    2. execute move + if statement
